So everything is about using "style" file

Lets say that we wanna customize the Toolbar, we just create style under styles.xml and apply it
to Toolbar like "app:theme="@style/blablabla" It's that easy.

About colors, don't try to create color patterns, that's horribly hard.
Use:
- https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette
- coolors.co
Those links are pretty useful, just apply them.

And about text sizes, dont't try to guess the text sizes. Google showed the way that it should be.
Just search for design patterns. I saw that Toolbar text sizes was on Google, or
slidenerd's first "Material Design" videos

** 24dp thing **
So on Kitkat and Lolipop, we have to adjust padding for Toolbar.

on values-19/styles.xml, annd values-21/styles.xml
<item name="android:windowTranslucentStatus">true</item> for status bar to get colored

on values-19/dimens.xml, annd values-21/dimens.xm
    <dimen name="defaultPadding">24dp</dimen> for;
     android:paddingTop="@dimen/defaultPadding" on TOOLBAR

I think Google uses this way too, this makes things equal with older devices
24 dp is something special
